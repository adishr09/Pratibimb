            <div style="margin-right: 3%; text-align: right">-Neha Singhal, BVCOE</div>

            <div style="margin: 3%; text-align: justify">
                <p style="float:left; display:inline"><img height="150" src="../booklet/images/ms/aw1.jpg" style="margin-right:10px" width="150"></p>
				<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p style="margin-left:10px">The movie is a narrative of Prakash Rathod, Commissioner of Police, Mumbai. The role, being played by Anupam Kher, brings about a fresh perspective about a police man, different from the usual lethargy and incompetence that we generally associate with one.</p>
		
                <p>The story also involves the brilliant Naseeruddin Shah, who as a normal citizen, is fed up of the incompetency of our politicians and their interference into judicial system. He plays the role of a hoax terrorist. He blackmails and forces Anupam Kher into releasing four terrorists, who are responsible for heinous terrorist acts of the past, but are still either in the jail or moving around freely, primarily due to the incompetence of our judicial and political system.</p>
				<p>He, after getting the terrorists released, kills them through a bomb blast. The movie gives a feeling of, “Yes, this is exactly what is to be done” and, “A good way to give them a taste of their own medicine”.</p>
				<p><b>Managerial Context</b></p>
				<p>The movie in itself has many instances when the production team has produced well thought-out plans. The way Naseeruddin Shah is named ‘Bastard’ by Anupam Kher and called that way throughout the movie, is something very unique to Bollywood. Also, the way some scenes are displayed in black and white for reflecting on past events and also flashbacks, involves the viewer into a deeper understanding about the movie.</p>
				<p>The movie also presents an opportunity to analyse two very opposite roles from a managerial perspective, one that of Naseeruddin Shah and the other that of Anupam Kher.</p>
                <p style=" margin-bottom:18px"></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div style="border: thick dashed; text-align: justify" title="third page">
            <div style="margin:3%; margin-bottom:28px">
				<p><b>Naseeruddin Shah</b></p>
                <p>The role played by Naseeruddin Shah is about marketing and communication. The way he cajoles Anupam Kher into believing that there are real bombs planted in the city, and that he can actually explode them if his demands are not met, is a lesson for every Sales and Marketing enthusiast. Also, the immaculate planning and use of technology by Naseeruddin Shah in the movie are enough to flatter any top strategist. Naseeruddin Shah makes sure that he leaves no trail behind him, so that police cannot trace either his identity or his location. And the deliberate clues and signs left at different places and with different people is enough to boggle any detective. He starts his plan by planting a bomb in a police station, just opposite the Police Head Quarters. This is no mean feat, but the ease with which he does it can only be achieved with great amount of planning.</p>
				<p>Throughout the movie, he displays an ability to be pro-active and foresees all the hurdles that could come in the way of his well chalked-out plan.</p>
				<p>He also displays excellent skills with technology. Throughout his conversations with Anupam Kher, he continuously changes his SIM card details using a laptop. Even the technical expert with the police department accepted that he could not trace the records of the numbers used by Naseeruddin Shah, and this technique can only be used by someone who is an expert in the field. Another weapon in Naseeruddin Shah’s armour was Media. The way he used a budding and ambitious media-woman to cover every aspect of his plan and the steps police were taking, shows how he had every base covered. He deliberately involved the media to know every step of the plan of action that the police were following, and at every location, viz-a-viz the Police Head Quarter, the airport where he wanted the police to take the four terrorists etc.</p>

            <div style="margin:3%; margin-bottom:28px">
				<p><b>Anupam Kher</b></p>
                <p>The role of Anupam Kher perfectly complemented that of Naseeruddin Shah, and he played it that way as well. The role basically revolved around a character that would understand Naseeruddin Shah’s psychology and try to mitigate his plans using all the resources at his disposal and also by planning the counter actions to be taken.</p>
				<p>When the police technical expert failed to trace the SIM details used by Naseeruddin Shah, Anupam Kher’s decision to involve a student to do the job was a master-stroke. As it turned out, he traced the location and Anupam Kher was finally able to locate and meet Naseeruddin Shah. </p>
				<p>Management graduates are expected to be efficient in involving the whole team and delegate responsibilities to the best possible person for that job. Anupam Kher did this with utmost precision and kept the whole team involved, still maintaining his superior hand in the whole operation and taking responsibility for the failures of the team to locate Naseeruddin Shah’s location. The role was not just confined to dealing with Naseeruddin Shah and his sub-ordinates. He had to take care of the nuisance media was creating thanks to the planning of Naseeruddin Shah, and also of the state Home Minister. The minister, as shown in the movie, is pretty powerless and out of sorts on decision-making instances. Anupam Kher had to convince him of the various actions police were taking and also assure him that those actions are required and would not affect his ministry negatively.</p>
				<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                <p>The characters of Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher, and the movie ‘A Wednesday’ in itself, provide an opportunity for analysing them from the perspective of management. And by doing so, a lot of theoretical concepts can be seen from a practical angle and how they can be implemented in real-life. The movie has direct marketing, sales and strategy theories being executed, and that too very effectively. In short, the movie is a very good learning base for a management graduate.</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px">Really? That’s what you thought? Alright boys, consider this. It’s Sachin’s last cricket test match today. As luck has it, your crush has agreed to go out for a movie with you on the same day. What’s your decision now? Tough call, isn’t it? Girls face a similar dilemma when they have to choose one between a lovely peplum dress from Zara and gorgeous pump heels from Aldo.</p>
				<p>We take decisions every day. Every little action requires us to analyze its reaction. And of course, we have to think about how that reaction will affect us. What all goes into this ‘process’ of decision making?</p>
				<p>Decision is a conclusion we reach at, after taking every possibility into consideration. Our daily routine revolves around the decisions we have taken or we will take in future. Small or big, decisions affect each and every person and the association it is involved with. So, it is an important aspect of Management.</p>
				<p>Whenever we think of a leader or manager, the first thing that comes to our mind is if the person is able to take accurate decisions in a given time and if he can decide the better option from the given alternatives. </p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div style="border: thick dashed; text-align: justify" title="third page">

				<img height="177" src="../booklet/images/ms/ayttdicp2.jpg" style="margin-right:10px" width="284">
				<p>Whenever one is taking a decision, the foremost priority is to keep in mind the profit or loss that might result from each alternative. Wherever we have to take a decision, there are some factors which cause problems and are common in every field, be it public or private sector. There are always some events which are not at all under the decision maker's control (which in managerial terms are called states of nature) and their existence causes great difficulties. We can understand this with the help of example. If you are a manager in some production industry, then there will be motor burnouts. It’s your decision to do preventive maintenance. Instead you decide to keep spare parts. However, you have no control over the burnout and what may be the rquirement of the machinery at that particular point.</p>
				<p>Now comes the uncertainties concerning with these states of nature. What will actually happen if the decision is taken? The manager would never know how many burnouts may take place and how many spare machinery would be required. The main criteria on the basis of which the decision is taken is the expected value. The alternative with expected profit is the better decision. But there are situations in which this is not the only dominating factor. Sometimes the decision to be taken solely depends upon the utility. Utility is the pleasure or displeasure that a certain outcome will derive. To understand utility we can take an example. In a bet with your friend over a toss of coin, he decides to pay you double if you win while you have to pay only the amount you betted to him. This bet started with ten bucks. You accepted the deal but he when wants to bet on ten thousand bucks (Yeah, your friend is greedy), you probably will ask him to stop playing around and do his work. Even though the expected outcome is attractive the thought of losing your money i.e. the utility here is prominent over the outcome. </p>

				<p>Whenever a decision is taken, a number of factors are to be taken care of. Now the tricky part is, even then one cannot be hundred percent sure whether he/she is right. So the next time you take a decision, just keep in mind all the pros and cons. Remember, not all decisions can lead to a positive result. And it’s good to make mistakes sometimes, they help you learn faster.</p>

            <h3 class="head" style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 25px; text-align: center">What To Do About Anxiety?</h3>

            <div style="margin-right: 3%; text-align: right">-Prerna Soni, BVCOE</div>

            <div style="margin: 3%; text-align: justify">
                <p style="float:left; display:inline"><img height="150" src="../booklet/images/ms/wtdaa1.jpg" style="margin-right:10px" width="150"></p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px"></p>
				<p>Anxiety and anxiety disorders are not diseases. According to Chamberlain, “One way that I think about anxiety is a simple mathematical equation: Something that we’re afraid of and the level of fear that we have about that is a multiplicative function of our assessment of the probability of the bad thing happening times the severity of the bad thing happening.”<br><center>f(level of fear) = assessment of probability x assessment of severity</center></p>
                <p>Chamberlain, a clinical psychologist educated at American University in Washington D.C., is an expert on anxiety and anxiety disorders. Okay, but some anxiety is good for us, right? It makes us study harder for exams, prepare more thoroughly for travel contingencies, prevents us from walking across busy highways, and, in a primeval sense, prepares us to fight or flee when we’re in danger. For instance, it might help you if your arm was trapped under a rock—anxiety and fear of being stuck under that rock forever would tell you to saw off your own arm to save your life.</p>
                <p>Disorders happen when the above equation is out of whack, and these things begin to happen:</p>
				<ul><li>The anxiety or fear you feel outweighs the actual danger or realistic probability of what you’re afraid of.</li>
				<li>The anxiety is highly painful and frequent.</li>
				<li>Being anxious interferes with your lifestyle and ability to function normally.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As a proponent of cognitive behavioral therapy, Chamberlain asserted that the most powerful behavioral intervention for anxiety is exposure. In other words, face your fears.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div style="border: thick dashed; text-align: justify" title="sixth page">
            <div style="margin: 3%; text-align: justify">
                <p>That means that Chamberlain, instead of avoiding public speaking because it makes his heart pound and his hands tremble, never passes up an opportunity to get up in front of people. If you are anxious around people of the opposite sex, talk to them as much as possible, he says. If you hate office parties, go to as many as possible. If you’re afraid of driving, get in your car and gradually get comfortable foot-to-pedal getting to the end of your driveway, to the end of your block, to the supermarket and back. </p>
				<img height="200" src="../booklet/images/ms/wtdaa2.jpg" style="margin:10px; float:right"width="150">
				<p>The solutions to it are simple. Nothing. This tactic can work because anxiety “tends to wax and wane.” Doing nothing about your anxiety can lead to simply avoiding whatever it is that makes you anxious. Avoidance can be debilitating if it affects your lifestyle or ability to function. Exercise, especially the aerobic kind—jogging, swimming, cycling, and walking— is the most effective remedy to anxiety. Meditation is an exercise in focusing your mind on what you want to be thinking about—your breath, a certain mantra, or a certain thought. It can help you learn to tune out the noise of irrational anxiety. Connecting with another person and not being alone with what you’re going through can be helpful. A second party can help you conduct a “reality test” as well, to gauge if you’re making too much of something, worrying too much, and can give alternate perspectives on what’s making you anxious and how probable or severe the consequences might be.</p>
				<p>A practitioner sometimes recommends medication to help alleviate the effects of anxiety for some people. Still, on its own, medication is not a viable option as a long term solution. A professional can offer experience and different perspectives on anxiety disorders unlike your family and friends. </p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px">One night, I, on my bed trying to sleep but unable do so, had a thought, “What do I exactly want to do in my life?’ Studying in second year of an engineering college, after two years I will be viewed as an engineer. But do I really want to be one? For some time I struggled with this question. Then I made a list of what I want from my profession and it goes on like this: money, a fat pay package (who doesn’t want that?), power and status! Yes, I want all this. Now what should I do? And then I got my answer finally. It’s ‘MANAGEMENT’. The best option that suits my requirements.</p>
				<p style="margin:10px">Probably there are different criteria to check whether one can be a good manager or not. First and foremost, a person should have self confidence. Trust yourself and manage the work properly. Be positive and appreciate the work of others.</p>
				

                <p style="margin-left:10px">A good manager is not only good by his work but also by his nature. Self motivation, integrity, reliability, calmness, flexibility are some of personal characteristics of a good manager. One should be optimistic and possess an attitude which inspires other people you’re working with. It must help them getting things done.</p>
                <img height="210" src="../booklet/images/ms/aymm2.jpg"style="margin:10px; float:right" width="154.5">
				<p style="margin:10px">Apart from personal characteristics one should be able to communicate effectively. To be an effective communicator, one should know how to speak in public, proclaiming ideas whether in an interview or while giving instructions to his/her fellow members. One should organize his/her presentations well. Be obstinate about his/her viewpoint, one should understand clearly what he/she wants to say. A manager with good communication skills should possess good listening skills too. One should listen carefully to one’s seniors, fellow members and juniors.</p>
                <p style=" margin-bottom:58px"></p>

		<div style="border: thick dashed; text-align: justify" title="eighth page">
           <p style="margin:10px">If you are dreaming of organizing or managing an enterprise then again you need to acquire management skills. As an entrepreneur your work is to solve problems, create new ideas and implement them. Combining these skills with your intelligence will not only amplify your leadership qualities but also maintain the dignity of your organization. As a leader you need to manage your team and coordinate between workers so as to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings. You are also required to regulate the performance of your whole team, as well as every individual. Monitor them wisely and bring the positive outcome and receive feedback. Thus, you will be able to represent yourself in public on the behalf of your team or organization, in an effective manner.</p>
		   <p style="margin:10px">Management is required not solely in a professional environment but also in personal life. You should be able develop relations with other people and manage them well. Make peace with everyone and also try to solve misunderstandings and avoid conflicts as much as possible. You should be able to mediate well between your superiors and co-workers. Work as a team with others and make sure you will hold up till the end. Respect others, only then will you gain respect from others. Learn to appreciate others’ views and let them know about their mistakes, if any, in a polite manner. Value those who care for you and abide with them.</p>
		   <p style="margin:10px">Thus a manager has to carry out different roles in everyday life. Organizing your team, resolving conflicts, generating new ideas and implementing them. The role of a manager is interesting as well as is a responsible task. So are you the ‘management’ material?</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px">Hey, look! Here pass millions of
                neutrinos from your book. Oh my God, now they have crossed the
                moon!</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px">You must be thinking, “What is it?
                I couldn’t see anything”. Well, relax. You are right. If you
                could actually see them, you wouldn’t have required a bulb to
                study at night. The small size and huge quantity of neutrinos
                furnish them with a tendency to behave similar to photons, thus
                imparting the potential to illuminate a night as a day. They
                are particles so light that even a 100,000 neutrinos may not
                balance one electron, but considering their titanic abundance
                in the universe, they may overtake the mass of matter present
                on our planet. Unfortunately, even half a century after their
                discovery, there’s little that we know about them.</p>

                <p>While studying the emissions produced in certain radioactive
                transitions, the existence of tiny neutral particles was first
                predicted by physicist Wolfgang Pauli. He asserted on the basis
                of certain observations and experiments that the virtually
                massless particles would rarely interact with matter.</p>

                Solar Neutrinos engender as a result of the nuclear reactions
                taking place in the core of the Sun and other stars. In due
                course of time, the ongoing research and experiments have
                indicated that even animals and humans produce another class of
                neutrinos as a byproduct of decomposition of their skeletal
                system.</p>

            The low mass and neutral charge of a neutrino impart it an
            exceedingly weak interaction with other particles and fields. Such
            attributes interest scientists because they indicate that neutrinos
            can be used to probe environments that other radiations (such as
            light or radio waves) cannot penetrate, thereby making it a
            particle of paramount importance to disentangle many mysteries.
            Alas, catching their holy grail is nothing less than catching a
            ghost!</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px">Have you ever tried to climb the
                walls like a ‘SPIDERMAN’ or found yourself boasting about your
                very own bulletproof ‘IRONMAN’ suit? A sound sleep with ‘sweet
                dreams’, wasn’t it? Well, it is not a dream anymore. Troy
                Hurtubise’s latest invention, ‘The Trojan S Series’ is a
                protective suit of modern armor i.e. the Ironman. Hurtubise
                claims that the suit, which is just weighing 13.6 kilograms,
                can withstand gunshots from a very close range and is light and
                flexible, making it easy to run, climb and drive in. This was
                made possible because of the ballistic grade protective panel
                which he invented and used in the Trojan Suit. This panel is
                able to deflect twelve bore shots and knives. So if you want to
                become the next Ironman you will just have to pay £35,000! But
                if you are not really interested in the Ironman, you can rather
                glide over the Gotham city like our own ‘BATMAN’. The
                ‘Gryphon’, having a wingspan of 1.8 meters and weighing 30
                kilograms, is made up of light and durable material like carbon
                fiber. It can cruise for 50 kilometers and when pointed
                downwards, the Gryphon can reach to a terminal velocity of 250
                miles per hour, fast enough to dodge away the Joker’s bullet
                easily.</p>

                <p>Designed and developed by Spelco, the Gryphon costs around £
                10,300. Unfortunately if you or your kids want to become the
                next Spiderman, you will just have to wait a little. Keeping in

                mind the pace at which modern technology supersedes itself, it
                won’t take very long. A wave of robots is in development that
                would climb vertical surfaces by using the phenomenon of
                induced electrostatic attraction, which is induced between the
                climbing</p>

            the current allows the pads to move. Current prototypes can carry
            up to 34 kilograms of weight and according to Nicola Pugno, who is
            currently working on the man version size of this robot, there is
            no fundamental reason that why can a robot not carry 90 kilograms
            of weight.</p>

            <p style="margin:10px">Transforming dreams into reality,
            today’s technology can turn you into any superhero you want. So all
            the fans get ready to become the next superhero and save your city!
            Needless to say, with great power, comes great responsibility.</p>
