			<p style="margin-left:10%"> For a digitally enhanced view of real environment, a new technology i.e., Augmented reality is here by which we can get a digitally modified view of physical and real time environment which increases user’s virtual perception. This technology senses input signals like sound, videos, graphic etc. using sensors technology available on devices and provide its enhance and descriptive view digitally. It brings the virtual world to the reality with a new 3-D experience. In Augmented displays all graphics, videos, elements appears with description along with the audio output.</p></p>

We often say “though we cannot decide how we take birth on earth but, we can at least have a thought about how we would like to die”. Now, let me tell you that there was a time when people were not even given the freedom to think. They did not have any rights, and even a small offence committed by them led towards torture or death. Death machines in ancient times were designed to provide the highest degree of torture and were very advanced. All these were used with a belief that these types of punishments would teach a lesson to the guilty and help cleanse the society. After knowing about these machines, I bet you would rather feel sorry for the criminal or the guilty!</p> Let us now start having a look at some of these devious devices.<br><p>
 
 <b>THE BRAZEN BULL</b>
  <p style="float:left; display:inline">  
 <img src="../booklet/images/tech/dm1.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="margin-right:10px" >
			<p style="margin-left:10%"> This was an execution device which was used by the ancient Greek. The
 bull was made up entirely of bronze and was hollow 
 from inside with a door on one side. The guilty was put inside
 and locked, with a fire lighted beneath the bull. 
 The metal was heated until the person inside was roasted to 
 death. Screaming of the person was used to 
 entertain the people and the executioners around! Can you 
 even picture this! Limit of cruelty!</p>
 </p> <br>
<b> THE ELECTRIC CHAIR.    </b> <p style="float:left; display:inline">  
 <img src="../booklet/images/tech/dm2.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px" >
<p style="margin-left:10%"> AThe victim was tied to the chair and two electrodes
                                                                      were attached to his body, one on the head and 
                                                                      the other on the leg to create a closed path for the   
                                                                      current to flow. And then, current was passed             
                                                                        through the victim’s body, gradually raised to
                                                                        2000 volts, leading to the immediate death<br>

<b> THE RACK   </b> <p style="float:left; display:inline">  
 <img src="../booklet/images/tech/dm2.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="margin-left:10px" >
<p style="margin-left:10%"> Again designed for brutality. It contained a rectangular platform with two rollers attached on either side. The guilty was made to lie down, his wrists and feet were chained to the respective rollers and then with the help of a rollers were rolled along and also the chains. This increasing force stretched the victim’s body, giving excruciating pain. Thai was continued till the victim’s shoulder and hip joints broke leading to death.   </p></p><br>

<b style="margin-left:20px"> THE PENDULUM   </b> <br><p style="float:left; display:inline">  
<img src="../booklet/images/tech/dm3.gif" width="150" height="150" style="margin-left:10px" >
<p style="margin-left:10%"> Personally, I think this is the worst on crossing all limits of
                                 torture and pain. In this, the guilty
                                        was made to lie down on a rectangular
                                                   platform and was tied to it. Above him was a
                                                blade which was made to swing to and fro,
                                                                       and it was gradually lowered. This lead to gradual cutting
                                         of the victim’s stomach and intestines.
                                                This was done slowly for at least 1-2 days. 
  </p></p> 	
<br><br>
<b style="margin-left:20px"> THE GARROTE   </b> <br><p style="float:left; display:inline">  
<img src="../booklet/images/tech/dm5.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="margin-left:10px" >
<p style="margin-left:10%"> The person was tied to a wooden stake with        
                                                            the help of a rope around his neck. This rope was        
                                                            twisted and tightened by the executioner till the 
                                                            person died. As technology improved, the wooden
                                                            stake was replaced by a wooden chair and the rope with
                                                            a metal band.

  These were just a few, there were many. So what do you think now? Was this the apt way of punishing? Was this the apt usage of machines?<br><br>

			<p style="margin-left:10%"> Let’s imagine a world where robots can assemble to make a wall, bridge or shelter during a calamity or emergency situation or could be formed into a chair, a ladder, or a desk, on demand. Let’s stop here and start from beginning with what kind of robots do we expect and what kind of robot is available as of now. Well the difference between the two is huge. <br><br>
            <b>
What we have is-<br></b>
Huge machines that work on specific tasks. 
Robots those are architecture specific.<br>


</p></p>
<b>What we expect is-<br></b>
Super smart robots that can modify according to our needs, as and when required. 
Robots that are light weight and can change its shape, leap, self-assemble and climb by self on any terrain. 
So what we want is basically modular robots.<br><br>	
And the questions are-<br>
<b>	What are they? </b>Basically these are modular self-reconfiguring robotic systems are autonomous kinematic machines with variable morphology. 
                
                <p><strong>Why do we need them?</strong> Because they are able to deliberately change their own shape by rearranging the connectivity of their parts, in order to adapt to new circumstances, perform new tasks, or recover from damage. 
<strong><br><br>Which type of modular robots are we talking about and what makes them different?</strong> M-blocks – these robots are cubes without any external moving parts while other modular bots in past used arms. These can flip, leap through air, roll across the ground and jump over each other without wheels, legs or arms.

            	<p style="float:left; display:inline">  
			<p style="margin-left:10%"> <strong>How M-blocks work?</strong> Well these bots work on basic principles of angular momentum and smart tricks applied on magnets. A flywheel with 20000 rpm when stopped, transfers its angular momentum to the cube that’s each edge and face has permanent magnets.<br><br>
With each edge equipped with two cylindrical magnets which naturally rotate and north poles aligns with south and vice versa. “Any face of any cube can thus attach to any face of any other.”<br><br>
The cube’s edges are bevelled, when cubes are face to face, a slight gap between magnets still exists. When one cube begins to flip on top of another, the bevels, and hence the magnets, come in contact and then two cubes tend to adhere strongly. There are four more pairs of smaller magnets on each face arranged symmetrically, which help to put a moving cube into place when it places itself over other one. <br><br>
Right now they are being controlled by radio frequency and Wi-Fi signals with variety of algorithms being implemented.<br><br>
The scope is too wide to be explained here but a day is not far when the modularization meets miniaturization and we may have tiny little bots as small as that of sand grain combining to form a huge robot. <br><br>
