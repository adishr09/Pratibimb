			<p style="margin-left:10%"> For a digitally enhanced view of real environment, a new technology i.e., Augmented reality is here by which we can get a digitally modified view of physical and real time environment which increases user’s virtual perception. This technology senses input signals like sound, videos, graphic etc. using sensors technology available on devices and provide its enhance and descriptive view digitally. It brings the virtual world to the reality with a new 3-D experience. In Augmented displays all graphics, videos, elements appears with description along with the audio output.</p></p>

                <p>In today’s scenario, there are so many smart applications available which are integrated with this technology and present the best use of augmented reality technology. Some of the popular applications of Augmented Reality are QR-Code Reader, Word lens, AR Compass, Google Glasses etc. which have made a very impressive impact on modern technology.</p>

                 <p>Another most widely increasing application of augmented reality is in ‘Virtual Gaming’. In Gaming, augmented technology allows user to conquer territory virtually by allowing graphic from screen to pull in the real world which is a attracting a mass population of users toward virtual world of Augmented Reality.
                 Other best use of the technology is conversion of different foreign languages into tourist’s local understandable language by just a virtual input of description, signal and other useful documents.</p>
                 <p>
With the modernization of technology, Augmented Reality is integrating the new virtual world to real physical world with so many new impressive features and functions which is the point of attraction for every technology enthusiast.

We often say “though we cannot decide how we take birth on earth but, we can at least have a thought about how we would like to die”. Now, let me tell you that there was a time when people were not even given the freedom to think. They did not have any rights, and even a small offence committed by them led towards torture or death. Death machines in ancient times were designed to provide the highest degree of torture and were very advanced. All these were used with a belief that these types of punishments would teach a lesson to the guilty and help cleanse the society. After knowing about these machines, I bet you would rather feel sorry for the criminal or the guilty!</p> Let us now start having a look at some of these devious devices.<br><p>
 
 <b>THE BRAZEN BULL</b>
  <p style="float:left; display:inline">  
 <img src="../booklet/images/tech/dm1.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="margin-right:10px" >
			<p style="margin-left:10%"> This was an execution device which was used by the ancient Greek. The
 bull was made up entirely of bronze and was hollow 
 from inside with a door on one side. The guilty was put inside
 and locked, with a fire lighted beneath the bull. 
 The metal was heated until the person inside was roasted to 
 death. Screaming of the person was used to 
 entertain the people and the executioners around! Can you 
 even picture this! Limit of cruelty!</p>
 </p> <br>
<b> THE ELECTRIC CHAIR.    </b> <p style="float:left; display:inline">  
 <img src="../booklet/images/tech/dm2.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px" >
<p style="margin-left:10%"> AThe victim was tied to the chair and two electrodes
                                                                      were attached to his body, one on the head and 
                                                                      the other on the leg to create a closed path for the   
                                                                      current to flow. And then, current was passed             
                                                                        through the victim’s body, gradually raised to
                                                                        2000 volts, leading to the immediate death<br>

<b> THE RACK   </b> <p style="float:left; display:inline">  
 <img src="../booklet/images/tech/dm2.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="margin-right:10px" >
<p style="margin-left:10%"> Again designed for brutality. It contained a rectangular platform with two rollers attached on either side. The guilty was made to lie down, his wrists and feet were chained to the respective rollers and then with the help of a rollers were rolled along and also the chains. This increasing force stretched the victim’s body, giving excruciating pain. Thai was continued till the victim’s shoulder and hip joints broke leading to death.   </p></p><br>

<b style="margin-left:20px"> THE PENDULUM   </b> <br><p style="float:left; display:inline">  
<img src="../booklet/images/tech/dm3.gif" width="150" height="150" style="margin-right:10px" >
<p style="margin-left:10%"> Personally, I think this is the worst on crossing all limits of
                                 torture and pain. In this, the guilty
                                        was made to lie down on a rectangular
                                                   platform and was tied to it. Above him was a
                                                blade which was made to swing to and fro,
                                                                       and it was gradually lowered. This lead to gradual cutting
                                         of the victim’s stomach and intestines.
                                                This was done slowly for at least 1-2 days.
