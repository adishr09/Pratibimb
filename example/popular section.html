			<p style="margin-left:10%"> All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Architects of language must consider revising the proverb because today, for that matter, ‘dull’ boys like Jack build dexterous robotic arms to save a bit of trouble to their mother in the kitchen. No wonder, if some other Jack experiments tomorrow to teleport his father directly to office! Conspicuously, generations have seen a transformation of children’s interest from watching Tom and Jerry and reading Archie’s comics, to watching Dexter’s Laboratory and reading Sherlock Holmes. </p></p>

                <p>Taking a break from the usual entertainment, science-obsessed teens today have a fire in their bellies to untangle mysteries and satisfy their curiosity. As well deserved appreciation, some of the geeks are being bestowed upon worldwide recognition through various platforms. A finalist of the recent Google Science fair, 18 year old Charalampos Ioannou from Greece has built a motion-sensing glove that activates motors to boost hand muscles. Far from one’s imagination, the glove’s primary application is to enhance the ability of aged people to grasp everyday objects firmly in their hands. Viney Kumar from Sydney, another high school geek felicitated at the fair has utilized Android mapping technology to create a downloadable application that updates the user if there is any emergency vehicle in the vicinity.</p>

                 <p>Surprisingly, all it took was the lad’s curiosity to know what more than the GPS in his cell-phone should it take to update drivers more quickly than sirens, making way for an ambulance stuck in traffic. If that isn’t astonishing enough, a science student from British Columbia, distressed at the plight of her friend studying without electricity, got engaged into experimenting with solid-state devices.She eventually created a flashlight that runs without any batteries! Just so you know, the girl made ‘Peltier Tiles’ absorb the body’s heat and converted it into electricity.
<p>
Teenagers today exploit many wireless systems daily, but not many wonder how to make use of this luxury to meet ‘needs’. Playing around with radio frequency devices, Brad Mager devised a three-dimensional system that alerts caretakers if someone has fallen to the ground. Another similar device built by roboticists integrates obstacle sensors and a Bluetooth device with a walking stick, thus giving crucial warnings to blind people by the use of a headset.
</p><p>
With many such accomplishments being reported daily, it shouldn’t go unnoticed that the wonders marveled by these ‘geeks’ have kindled out of a straight-forward approach, providing solutions that cater to necessity rather than pandering man with luxury. By conceptualizing reality instead of imagination, they teach us an important lesson: Doing science is light-years away from studying science. Yet, all it takes to bridge the gap is curiosity. Geeky, is definitely the new sexy!

We often say “though we cannot decide how we take birth on earth but, we can at least have a thought about how we would like to die”. Now, let me tell you that there was a time when people were not even given the freedom to think. They did not have any rights, and even a small offence committed by them led towards torture or death. Death machines in ancient times were designed to provide the highest degree of torture and were very advanced. All these were used with a belief that these types of punishments would teach a lesson to the guilty and help cleanse the society. After knowing about these machines, I bet you would rather feel sorry for the criminal or the guilty!</p> Let us now start having a look at some of these devious devices.<br><p>
 <b>THE BRAZEN BULL</b><br><br><img src="../booklet/images/tech/dm1.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="margin-left:10px" >
 This was an execution device which was used by the ancient Greek. The
 bull was made up entirely of bronze and was hollow 
 from inside with a door on one side. The guilty was put inside
 and locked, with a fire lighted beneath the bull. 
 The metal was heated until the person inside was roasted to 
 death. Screaming of the person was used to 
 entertain the people and the executioners around! Can you 
 even picture this! Limit of cruelty!</p>

 THE RACK   
                                                                                 Again designed for brutality. It contained a                      
                                                                                 rectangular platform with two rollers attached on   
                                                                     either side. The guilty was made to lie down,                                
                                                                     his wrists and feet were chained to the respective
                                                                     rollers and then with the help of a pulley, the 
                                                                     rollers were rolled along and also the chains. 
                                                                     This increasing force stretched the         
                                                                                 victim’s body, giving excruciating pain. Thai was continued
                                                                                 till the victim’s shoulder and hip
                                                                                 joints broke leading to death.                                                                          lets just move on to the next one.       


                                                                                                                






           THE PENDULUM.                                                    
                                                                                    Personally, I think this is the worst on crossing all limits of
                                 torture and pain. In this, the guilty
                                        was made to lie down on a rectangular
                                                   platform and was tied to it. Above him was a
                                                blade which was made to swing to and fro,
                                                                       and it was gradually lowered. This lead to gradual cutting
                                         of the victim’s stomach and intestines.
                                                This was done slowly for at least 1-2 days. 






                                                                       THE ELECTRIC CHAIR. 
                                                                      The victim was tied to the chair and two electrodes
                                                                      were attached to his body, one on the head and 
                                                                      the other on the leg to create a closed path for the   
                                                                      current to flow. And then, current was passed             
                                                                        through the victim’s body, gradually raised to
                                                                        2000 volts, leading to the immediate death.   






                                                           THE GARROTE
                                                            The person was tied to a wooden stake with        
                                                            the help of a rope around his neck. This rope was        
                                                            twisted and tightened by the executioner till the 
                                                            person died. As technology improved, the wooden
                                                            stake was replaced by a wooden chair and the rope with
                                                            a metal band. 
                                                       
These were just a few, there were many. So what do you think now? Was this the apt way of punishing? Was this the apt usage of machines?
