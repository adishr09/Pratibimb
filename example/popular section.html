			<p style="margin-left:10px"> All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Architects of language must consider revising the proverb because today, for that matter, ‘dull’ boys like Jack build dexterous robotic arms to save a bit of trouble to their mother in the kitchen. No wonder, if some other Jack experiments tomorrow to teleport his father directly to office! Conspicuously, generations have seen a transformation of children’s interest from watching Tom and Jerry and reading Archie’s comics, to watching Dexter’s Laboratory and reading Sherlock Holmes. </p></p>

                <p>Taking a break from the usual entertainment, science-obsessed teens today have a fire in their bellies to untangle mysteries and satisfy their curiosity. As well deserved appreciation, some of the geeks are being bestowed upon worldwide recognition through various platforms. A finalist of the recent Google Science fair, 18 year old Charalampos Ioannou from Greece has built a motion-sensing glove that activates motors to boost hand muscles. Far from one’s imagination, the glove’s primary application is to enhance the ability of aged people to grasp everyday objects firmly in their hands. Viney Kumar from Sydney, another high school geek felicitated at the fair has utilized Android mapping technology to create a downloadable application that updates the user if there is any emergency vehicle in the vicinity.</p>

                 <p>Surprisingly, all it took was the lad’s curiosity to know what more than the GPS in his cell-phone should it take to update drivers more quickly than sirens, making way for an ambulance stuck in traffic. If that isn’t astonishing enough, a science student from British Columbia, distressed at the plight of her friend studying without electricity, got engaged into experimenting with solid-state devices.She eventually created a flashlight that runs without any batteries! Just so you know, the girl made ‘Peltier Tiles’ absorb the body’s heat and converted it into electricity.
<p>
Teenagers today exploit many wireless systems daily, but not many wonder how to make use of this luxury to meet ‘needs’. Playing around with radio frequency devices, Brad Mager devised a three-dimensional system that alerts caretakers if someone has fallen to the ground. Another similar device built by roboticists integrates obstacle sensors and a Bluetooth device with a walking stick, thus giving crucial warnings to blind people by the use of a headset.
</p><p>
With many such accomplishments being reported daily, it shouldn’t go unnoticed that the wonders marveled by these ‘geeks’ have kindled out of a straight-forward approach, providing solutions that cater to necessity rather than pandering man with luxury. By conceptualizing reality instead of imagination, they teach us an important lesson: Doing science is light-years away from studying science. Yet, all it takes to bridge the gap is curiosity. Geeky, is definitely the new sexy!

				<div align = "right" style="margin-right:3%;">-Payal Mangla, BVCOE</div>
	       <div style="margin:3%">
            	<p style="float:left; display:inline">  <img src="../booklet/images/pop/3.jpg" width="284" height="177" style="margin-right:10px" >
			<p style="margin-left:10px">It is sometimes so difficult to believe or even think about the existence of some things, and that’s because these are so different from normal that our mind is unable to accept them or the reasoning behind them. This is somewhat true for Black Holes, one of the strangest things ever dreamt or seen by science.</p>
<p 	>Black Holes were first of all pointed out in 1783. It was brought forward that there are some regions in space that could not be seen but a very strong impact of force could be felt around them. This was the gravitational force due to a massive star, so strong that even light could not escape. Such regions or objects of space were then called Dark Stars and are now called Black Holes.
 </p></p>                
                <p>Suppose there is a massive star that has burnt up its nuclear fuel completely, then if it cools and shrinks below a critical size, it will literally end up making a hole in space that light can’t get out of, i.e., a Black Hole. From the outside you can’t tell what is inside a black hole. Even when you throw something inside a black hole and once its inside, you are wrong if you say that you know what you threw inside, because all that black hole remembers is the total mass and the state of rotation. Everything else gets lost inside. The force experienced due to a black hole varies with positioning; it is strongest at its boundary which is called the Event Horizon. Even light gets trapped inside at this region, and since nothing can travel faster than light, everything else also can be pulled inside.  </p>

                <p style="margin:10px">Once you fall in a black hole, as for the outside world, you would be lost forever. The only thing that remains in the black hole is information. All the mass inside the black hole gets converted into energy (E= mc squared) and energy finally into information. So, bigger the black hole more is the information inside it. But it was also discovered that particles could leak out of a black hole but on a very small scale, if they somehow happened to travel at a speed greater than light. This was brought forward after the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle; you may know the position of a particle, that it’s in the black hole, accurately, but then, not the speed it may have inside.</p>
                <p style="margin:10px">If particles escape from black holes, they will eventually start losing information and as a result, will shrink and may even disappear. But the problem is that what comes out of a black hole has no relation with what goes in, i.e., something random will come out. The information for what fell in is completely lost apart from the total mass. Right now we don’t have any black holes near us but what if we do in future? It is therefore very important to determine whether information really gets lost in black holes, whether it can be recovered or preserved.</p>
