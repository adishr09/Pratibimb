            Welcome to the 2013 online edition of Pratibimb, the official biannual magazine of BVPIEEE. BVPIEEE has always strived to cater to multi-dimensional interests and has stayed true to that motto with Pratibimb, which records contributions from students all across Delhi and 'reflects' their literary abilities.
</p><p>
BVPIEEE, since its advent almost 8 years ago, has always promoted IEEE as a platform to share knowledge through interactive sessions, seminars, conferences and field trips, thereby staying true to the essence of IEEE. It has been a learning process more than anything and throughout this course, we at the student branch have successfully conducted various technical events in every academic session, winning awards and recognition in the process. More than that, it has been the establishment of a talent pool where students interact and exchange ideas with people from various institutes and disciplines, that makes us proud. We aim to further expand the branch in the near future and are looking forward to conduct our two premier events- the annual fest 'Fervour' and the 'Dr. Vikram Sarabhai Rotating Shield Quiz'- with enthusiasm and zeal.
</p><p>
We release, with utmost pride and enthusiasm, the newest edition of Pratibimb with promise of an even bigger published edition during Fervour. For any further queries and reviews, feel free to contact us. We look forward to a positive response in the near future and hope your association with BVPIEEE will be an enriching experience.</p>

Regards,<br>

           Dear Reader,<br>
<p>
PRATIBIMB, true to its meaning, has been a reflection of the creative talents. It epitomizes the virtues and encompasses the laurels of the vibrant BVPIEEE. With the passing of each year, a new chapter is added to this grand chronicle. 
Pratibimb celebrates the ‘Passion for Perfection’ and is indeed a stimulant to future excellence. This time the responsibility has been bestowed upon us to give BVPIEEE journal a new dimension, and color it with the palette of our creations. The entire team has been immensely enriched to be a part of this grand ensemble. We have strived to include all the proceedings and accomplishments of the branch in these pages. </p><p>
We express our sincere gratitude towards our Principal, Prof. M. S. Bhattacharya, our Branch Counselor, Prof. Rahul Bahl and the Editorial Mentor, Prof. Yogita Arora for their unflinching support, constant encouragement and munificent guidance. In addition, we would like to thank the members of the BVPIEEE Web designing team who helped make this publication possible. A lot of discussion, brainstorming and sleepless nights later, the magazine has turned out as we had envisioned. A venture of this kind could never have been undertaken without the efforts of our skilled website designers; it is their relentless toil that has made this e-journal a reality.</p><p>
With these few words, we present to you the online edition of Pratibimb 2012, in the hope that you will enjoy reading it as much as we did creating it.</p>

 
<br>

Literally yours,<br>
Sindhu Jayakumar<br>
Editor-in-Chief<br>
