When the morning awakes, to the dark night it waves.<br>
My feelings persuade me to again perambulate.<br>
To feel the Sun, the Breeze, as they come my way.<br>
But look oh unfortunate! This world takes it all away.<br>
The gay that fades when it says, “A lot is to be done, mend your ways.”<br>
Materialism that takes it all over, the craving for money makes them hover.<br>
Indifferent! Pityingly, I glance and move on to the beats,<br>

            <p style="margin-left:10px">    A Mother is symbolic of a figure that is patient, loving and caring, and here by loving and caring I do not mean being conscious about her child's success or prohibiting its freedom for the sake of so called protection or scolding the child when it scores low or does not listen to her. The love of a Mother is intense, deep and most importantly, sacrificial. It cares about the needs of the child. It respects its feelings. It is never boastful. It accepts the situations of parting with the child, obviously with a sweet pain. It trusts! In short, it is the most blissful feeling! "MAMTA"- Motherly Affection!</p>

               "A single rose can be my garden and a single friend, my world." Sometimes a single person is capable of making you happy, when a crowd of people fail to do so. Unlike the rest of the world, that person accepts you as you are, with neither any complaints nor demands.</p> <p style="margin-left:10px">

                <p style="margin-left:10px">For centuries, the perpetual motion
                machine has been regarded as the holy grail of science. Many
                scientists and inventors have tried to make it, but none have
                succeeded. A perpetual motion machine is basically a device
                which, once set in motion, continues to produce energy without
                any external intervention. Simply put, it is a wheel which
                continues to rotate till the end of time. Seems pretty
                far-fetched, doesn’t it?</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px">The whole concept of perpetual
                motion machine is flawed. It is basically a device which
                produces infinite energy, but according to the First Law of
                Thermodynamics, “Energy can neither be created nor be
                destroyed.”</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px">Another kind of perpetual motion
                machine is usually defined as one that completely eliminates
                friction and other dissipative forces, to maintain motion due
                to inertia of mass. But such a device is impossible to make, as
                friction cannot be eliminated totally in any
                system.</p><img height="210" src="../booklet/images/lit/8.jpg"

                <p>Early designs of perpetual motion machine were made by
                Indian mathematician Bhaskara-II, during the 12th century.
                Bhaskara described an overbalanced wheel that he claimed would
                run forever. Leonardo Da Vinci made numerous drawings of
                devices that he believed would make free energy. Another 16th
                century Italian scholar proposed a self-blowing windmill.
                Robert Boyle devised a perpetual motion cup which he claimed
                could sustain fluid flow forever. More perpetual motion devices
                followed in 17th century. None of these worked.</p>

            <p style="margin:10px">In 1775, The Royal Academy of Sciences in
            Paris, having had enough, made a statement that “The Academy will
            no longer accept or deal with proposals concerning perpetual
            motion.” Later, even the United States Patent and Trademark Office
            made an official policy of refusing applications regarding
            perpetual motion machine without a working model.</p>

            <p style="margin:10px">Regardless of this, the madness behind
            perpetual motion machine still continues and every year the patent
            offices around the world receive many applications regarding
            perpetual motion machines, most of them fraudulent or
            non-working.</p>

            <p style="margin:10px">Even though I am not the type to discourage
            new inventors, but still I would like them to steer clear from
            perpetual motion because it’s long been established that it’s a
            wild goose chase. As appropriately put by Leonardo Da
            Vinci,<br></p><center><strong>“Oh ye seekers after perpetual motion, how

                <p style="margin-left:10px">Hey, look! Here pass millions of
                neutrinos from your book. Oh my God, now they have crossed the

                <p style="margin-left:10px">You must be thinking, “What is it?
                I couldn’t see anything”. Well, relax. You are right. If you
                could actually see them, you wouldn’t have required a bulb to
                study at night. The small size and huge quantity of neutrinos
                furnish them with a tendency to behave similar to photons, thus
                imparting the potential to illuminate a night as a day. They
                are particles so light that even a 100,000 neutrinos may not
                balance one electron, but considering their titanic abundance
                in the universe, they may overtake the mass of matter present
                on our planet. Unfortunately, even half a century after their
                discovery, there’s little that we know about them.</p>

                <p>While studying the emissions produced in certain radioactive
                transitions, the existence of tiny neutral particles was first
                predicted by physicist Wolfgang Pauli. He asserted on the basis
                of certain observations and experiments that the virtually
                massless particles would rarely interact with matter.</p>

                course of time, the ongoing research and experiments have
                indicated that even animals and humans produce another class of
                neutrinos as a byproduct of decomposition of their skeletal
                system.</p>

            The low mass and neutral charge of a neutrino impart it an
            exceedingly weak interaction with other particles and fields. Such
            attributes interest scientists because they indicate that neutrinos
            can be used to probe environments that other radiations (such as
            light or radio waves) cannot penetrate, thereby making it a
            particle of paramount importance to disentangle many mysteries.
            Alas, catching their holy grail is nothing less than catching a

                <p style="margin-left:10px">Have you ever tried to climb the
                walls like a ‘SPIDERMAN’ or found yourself boasting about your
                very own bulletproof ‘IRONMAN’ suit? A sound sleep with ‘sweet
                dreams’, wasn’t it? Well, it is not a dream anymore. Troy
                Hurtubise’s latest invention, ‘The Trojan S Series’ is a
                protective suit of modern armor i.e. the Ironman. Hurtubise
                claims that the suit, which is just weighing 13.6 kilograms,
                can withstand gunshots from a very close range and is light and
                flexible, making it easy to run, climb and drive in. This was
                made possible because of the ballistic grade protective panel
                which he invented and used in the Trojan Suit. This panel is
                able to deflect twelve bore shots and knives. So if you want to
                become the next Ironman you will just have to pay £35,000! But
                if you are not really interested in the Ironman, you can rather
                glide over the Gotham city like our own ‘BATMAN’. The
                ‘Gryphon’, having a wingspan of 1.8 meters and weighing 30
                kilograms, is made up of light and durable material like carbon
                fiber. It can cruise for 50 kilometers and when pointed
                downwards, the Gryphon can reach to a terminal velocity of 250
                miles per hour, fast enough to dodge away the Joker’s bullet
                easily.</p>

                <p>Designed and developed by Spelco, the Gryphon costs around £
                10,300. Unfortunately if you or your kids want to become the
                next Spiderman, you will just have to wait a little. Keeping in

                mind the pace at which modern technology supersedes itself, it
                won’t take very long. A wave of robots is in development that
                would climb vertical surfaces by using the phenomenon of
                induced electrostatic attraction, which is induced between the
                climbing</p>

            currently working on the man version size of this robot, there is
