When the morning awakes, to the dark night it waves.<br>
My feelings persuade me to again perambulate.<br>
To feel the Sun, the Breeze, as they come my way.<br>
But look oh unfortunate! This world takes it all away.<br>
The gay that fades when it says, “A lot is to be done, mend your ways.”<br>
Materialism that takes it all over, the craving for money makes them hover.<br>
Indifferent! Pityingly, I glance and move on to the beats,<br>

            <p style="margin-left:10px">    A Mother is symbolic of a figure that is patient, loving and caring, and here by loving and caring I do not mean being conscious about her child's success or prohibiting its freedom for the sake of so called protection or scolding the child when it scores low or does not listen to her. The love of a Mother is intense, deep and most importantly, sacrificial. It cares about the needs of the child. It respects its feelings. It is never boastful. It accepts the situations of parting with the child, obviously with a sweet pain. It trusts! In short, it is the most blissful feeling! "MAMTA"- Motherly Affection!</p>

               "A single rose can be my garden and a single friend, my world." Sometimes a single person is capable of making you happy, when a crowd of people fail to do so. Unlike the rest of the world, that person accepts you as you are, with neither any complaints nor demands.</p> <p style="margin-left:10px">

                <p style="margin-left:10px">Oliver twist and Annie would have been successful in etching their image of the orphanage in my head, if it wasn’t for that one day when we had to visit an orphanage. Our imagination of the orphanage died on the word dreary. For us, like many others, administrators of orphanages were cruel monsters, food and clothing was scarce, and the children savage. The facts somehow seemed to support my image of the orphanages. The juvenile home where underage criminals are sent is actually an orphanage run by the state. We come face to face with scams every day; the newspaper sure gives us a dose of it. There are many orphanages set up as a front to lure foreigners to pay school fees for children who are in turn employed for back-breaking work. There was news in the papers recently, stating that some owners deliberately kept the conditions of orphans miserable to attract more donations. To show you the rosy side, it’s not the same everywhere. We were greeted by the orphanage manager at the gate who ushered us in. The house had an air <img height="134" src="../booklet/images/lit/11.jpg"
                style="margin:10px; float:right" width="200">of vitality and by the look on the manager’s face you could tell how proud she was of her work. She showed us around the colorful dining house, the study room with a wall chest of books, the bedroom with bunker beds and the playroom filled with toys. What caught our eye was the infant room- soft pink bedding with a blanket of another shade of pink drawn over the little ones. Two housemaids were ready on their feet to do the needful always. When we were about to exit, the warden invited us for luncheon and one of the kids going by told us that ‘Chicken Biryani’ was on the menu. It was the first time we had caught a glimpse of developed India where innocence is catered to, not deceived. On our way out there was a board showing the orphanage’s successes in numbers. </p>

            <p style="margin:10px">The number of kids that were admitted from all parts of the country was huge. While exiting, we had a feeling which was difficult to name but it was of the best kind. It may sound cheesy but the exit from the gate may have ended this journey of our visit but it started a new one. We never went to the orphanage again but we still cherish those happy memories and it was the best thing that happened to us.</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px">How strange is it that life takes us to different places and we meet new people? This nature of life sometimes resembles a train journey. The way things happen when we travel in train, the same goes for life. We meet people, make intangible bonds and then bid adieu. The mysterious voyage of life contains the essence of the journey of a train. But there still lies a big difference, like the certain turns, halts and changing surroundings of train journey. These traits of life are much less obvious.

</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px">As we board a train, we meet new people, become friends in a few minutes and after a short while the connection appears to have reached the maximum “broadband frequency”. We chat, share emotions and have fun together. But then the train comes to a halt at a station and some of the co-passengers desert us. People who were so intimate only a few hours back, move to some other world leaving behind memories and a realization that the period of togetherness has come to its end. But then again, new passengers arrive and the cycle continues .But again we reach the same end point. Either of us has to deboard the train at a station and move on. Isn’t this what we actually experience in life?

</p>

                 <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:23px">Our childhood days and teenage, which we spend in schools and colleges, are no less than heaven. The fun, excitement and strong bonds which we share with school friends appear to be incessant. The lunch breaks, the stupid games, the class tests and the company of amazing friends in everything we do are seen as the key elements of our funny little  </p>

            width="294">  world. But then the dynamic nature of life breaks this stability and then
comes the separation. The promises of staying in touch and being the best buddies forever become so hollow. This lands us to our respective stations of college life.</p>

            <p style="margin:10px">The college provides a new life, new people and a place to create new memories. The goodbyes which we just said to a few are then followed by “hellos” to others. Then begins another journey, again a world of fun and frolic is created. Those whom we greeted with a formal smile initially are now the ones who compel us to burst into peals of laughter. They make us cherish every little moment of this beautiful life and stand by us through thick and thin. Therefore, by healing the older wounds of separation, they tie a thread of hope to our lives and promise to stay with us forever. And it’s the time when the smooth journey of life takes an unexpected turn and reminds us of different stations which lead to partition.<br><br>
Yes!!! Even college life ceases and the pain of being without our closest friends hurts the soul.<br><br>
It’s not just at different stages of our lives that the feeling of parting plays its role. It’s the law of nature which can greet us at any point of time. Sometimes it’s about very close relatives, our neighbors or someone we had not known for long but still had a strong connection emotionally.

</p>
<p style="margin:10px"> Unlike the train journeys in which the time, place and most importantly, the destination of other passengers is known, everything is uncertain in life. In life, the emotional bonds between people don’t allow them to accept the parting phase of any relationship and therefore the unexpected goodbyes prove to be very painful. Thus the feeling of being alone knocks at the door. At this point one often asks as to why life follows such a trend? Why does it always happen that those who add life to our lives have to leave it for us to live alone? Well, the interrogations can’t be solved certainly but there does exist a hope of other stations which will bring new passengers into our lives, who would fill it with the hope to encourage us to live happily.</p>

Your future is not determined by the school you graduate from. It’s determined by who you are as a human being. Higher education is an important tool for building character. It can be seen as climbing a high mountain. The higher you climb, the broader becomes your vision and the wider is the world that unfolds before you. You begin to see things that you could never see before. The question of where you study - whether at a school, a two-year college or a four-year university - is something that only you can decide, based on many factors, including your family circumstances, academic ability and personal desires and ambition. If you make the decision yourself, you’ll have no regrets later. You mustn’t live a life filled with indecision and lingering regret. You mustn’t feel jealous of others. There is no easy path to success.</p><p style="margin-left:10px; ">
Then, what is the purpose of our life’s journey? Obviously, to be happy. What is happiness then? It’s all about feeling contented and attaining personal satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-left:10px; ">
What is fulfillment then? It is satisfaction or happiness as a result of fully developing one's abilities or character. That can be only done when we face difficulties in our lives. Without difficulties and challenges, there can be no fulfillment, and without fulfillment, there is no happiness. There is no happiness without hardship. Everyone forgets the process of battling hardships, and searches only for the end result - the destination of happiness. Instead “happiness is a journey, not a destination”.

It was a treasure I roamed for with fear yet I was bolder.<br>
Now I have reached the top of the staircase where there is nothing to look for ahead,<br>
I wish to climb down that wooden ladder, but sadly it has removed all its steps instead.</p>

It is resting there in peace before I do the same.<br>
I am shattered to the core,<br>
Even the pieces refuse to stay,<br>
I want to let go of them,<br>
But ultimately they are not just junks of clay.</p>
<p style="margin-left:10px">
A year ago, I had dreams to fulfil,<br>
I had emotions to share.<br>
Now I tend to react like a manikin robot,<br>
Programmed to drown a little deeper in despair.</p>
<p style="margin-left:10px">
I had family to understand me, parents to care.<br>
I have ruined even that relation.<br>
Now they are just acquaintances in a traumatic fare,<br>
The respect we had for each other has snapped out in the dark,<br>
We talk just to deceive ourselves with condolence of doubt that maybe still; we are a family though apart.
