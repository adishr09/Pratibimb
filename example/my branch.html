                <p>Fresh on Campus, an informal welcome of Freshers, organised on 23rd August, 2013 by BVPIEEE Execomm, 
				was a huge success in terms of participation and response. It was particularly aimed at introducing IEEE and it's Student Branch,
				furthermore bridging the gap between seniors and freshers. A list of tasks were handed over to the groups of students, 
				each group having not more than 5 participants.It was ensured though, that no two participants were from same the branch.  </p>

                <p>Tasks included writing slogans for BVPIEEE, finding particular coins, clicking particular pictures and many more fun filled activities. This was followed by a Photowalk in which the best picture clicked was awarded. While the participants showed incredible enthusiasm for the first ever, only event of it's kind; so did the volunteers. Student representatives, plus the auxiliary committee effectively managed the event, handling the turnout of more than a 100, which in itself is no easy task. It highly encouraged freshers to learn more about IEEE and it's events at Student Branch level, effect of which was observed in the events that followed. Formal introduction to IEEE alone saw a headcount of more than 150.</p>

IEEE Day 2013 was zestfully celebrated in our college on 1st of October to mark the anniversary of the day when IEEE members from all over the world gathered to share their technical ideas. With members, non - members and the executive team being part of the celebration, the event saw a huge turnout. The event spread the word of IEEE among freshmen and induced participation of students from all departments. Students showed their contribution by participating in the Hand Painting event organised on the day. Banner highlighting “IEEE DAY” was decorated with hand prints of enthusiastic students of the college. To show our exuberance on the day and pride to have IEEE chapter in the college, we also participated in 2013 IEEE Photo Contest. The main aim of the event was to celebrate the important day of engineers while initiating and motivating the students towards this plethoric technical organization. This year the theme of IEEE Day being “Leveraging Technology for a Better Tomorrow”, our student branch did the needful for the betterment of environment and humanity by hosting an opinion based contest. Student members were encouraged to kindle the fuel of engineering and propound ideas that shall leverage the advancing technology for energy conservation. The BVP-IEEE Entrepreneurship Cell paved the way from prototyping to commercialization, thus giving birth to a new start-up! A drop box placed in the campus gathered what innovative young minds came up with and the participants got to brag about their contribution by leaving a hand print on the BVPIEEE Green Wall!

It was an interactive session covering various facets of higher education. The discussion encompassed various exams like GRE, GMAT, TOEFL and IELTS, dealt with their eligibility criterion, emphasized upon which courses to undertake, explained admission procedure, described education loans and gave tips and tricks to ace the tests. The participants got two envelopes.

A team of four students from the IEEE student branch of Bharati Vidyapeeth’s College of Engineering, New Delhi, was sponsored by IEEE Eta Kappa Nu to attend this Congress for assisting the Educational Activities Board in making the honor society a stronger community in Asia-Pacific region.A booth was put up for two days in the exhibition area of Congress to brief delegates about the benefits of having an IEEE-HKN student chapter and the complete procedure to establish it. Since the selected students have managed to attract the attention of many people from various sections in Region 10, it is expected that this combined effort of HKN and Lambda Eta Chapter shall help IEEE-HKN grow further, transforming BVPIEEE into a distinguished parent branch.</p>

			<p>Robotix United (RU) is a Special Interest Group (SIG) under BVPIEEE which was established in 2010. This year RU has managed to be much more active in comparison to previous years. <br>
			Robotix United aims to bridge the gap between the students and technical knowledge and provide the technicalities related to robotics. It is an enriched source of knowledge for embedded systems and robotics.</p>

			<p>During the past two months, it has organised events and workshops for the improvement of students. It organised an orientation session briefing students and introducing them to the field of robotics. They grabbed a crowd of 90 students for the orientation session. To provide the basic understanding of differential drive, they managed to organise a workshop on differential drive robots. An excited crowd of 50 students successfully implemented this concept and developed a wired differential drive robot. </p>

			<p style="margin:10px">The enthusiasm of the crowd urged them to organize another workshop on the basics of Arduino Micro-controller. It organized three sessions for this workshop and again a crowd of about 50 students was present. Their next aim is to teach students the interfacing of different components using Arduino.<br><br>
			In order to maintain interest in robotics, RU presented some of the robots to show them what robotics is all about. They even organised an online quiz on robotics.<br><br>
			Whenever students face any problem, Robotix United has been a hope for help and it has continuously tried to keep up to their expectations by helping them in their personal projects or developing a robot for various technical fests.</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px"><strong>How has IEEE benefitted you?</strong><br>The question is a very difficult one to answer. Not because IEEE has not provided me anything, it has provided me too many things confusing me on what to start off with. IEEE has provided me a platform to learn, experiment and grow. The opportunities provided by IEEE are immense and I made sure I seized whatever opportunities came my way. Starting from the wide network of friends I possess to the public speaking and presentation skills. Today, I have conducted more than 100+ IEEE Events and have spoken at several forums in different genres. IEEE gave me my internship opportunity. 90 % of the skills required to be a part of an organization is imparted by volunteering in IEEE, which makes us easily compatible for any environment. IEEE allowed me to witness how difficult it is to run an organization. For what I am today as a Professional, I owe it to IEEE.</p>

                <p><strong>What is your message to students?</strong><br>If you are able to contribute towards IEEE with a lot of passion and selflessness, you are sure to reap the same benefits that I have reaped. It might not happen immediately. It might take time but the effects will definitely reach you someday. An advice, which I would give to students, would be to build a strong network of people around you. A lot of things in life could happen when you have a strong network of people with you. We need to realize one thing; Engineering is not only about clearing a lot of examinations and getting into a job. Do look into the other aspects of how you could improve yourself over a period of time. Most of the times, in the excitement to reach the destination or the goal of our life, we tend to forget that the JOURNEY is the best part of the DESTINATION!! Enjoy the Journey!! </p>
<p><strong> Mr. Nivas Ravichandran</strong> visited our college and enlightened students about the merits of startup. It was a very interactive and pragmatic session. All his points were well exemplified as he brought into light the various companies (Facebook, Flipkart etc.) which set off as startups. Many points like leadership, networking and work freedom were accentuated.  Later on, the queries of students were solved.  Indeed, it was an informative and beneficial event. </p>
