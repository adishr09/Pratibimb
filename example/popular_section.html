                build dexterous robotic arms to save a bit of trouble to their
                mother in the kitchen. No wonder, if some other Jack
                experiments tomorrow to teleport his father directly to office!
                Conspicuously, generations have seen a transformation of
                children’s interest from watching Tom and Jerry and reading
                Archie’s comics, to watching Dexter’s Laboratory and reading
                Sherlock Holmes.</p>
                <p>Taking a break from the usual entertainment,
                science-obsessed teens today have a fire in their bellies to
                untangle mysteries and satisfy their curiosity. As well
                deserved appreciation, some of the geeks are being bestowed
                upon worldwide recognition through various platforms. A
                finalist of the recent Google Science fair, 18 year old
                Charalampos Ioannou from Greece has built a motion-sensing
                glove that activates motors to boost hand muscles. Far from
                one’s imagination, the glove’s primary application is to
                enhance the ability of aged people to grasp everyday objects
                firmly in their hands. Viney Kumar from Sydney, another high
                school geek felicitated at the fair has utilized Android
                mapping technology to create a downloadable application that
                updates the user if there is any emergency vehicle in the
                vicinity.</p>
				<p>Surprisingly, all it took was the lad’s curiosity to know
                what more than the GPS in his cell-phone should it take to
                update drivers more quickly than sirens, making way for an
                ambulance stuck in traffic. If that isn’t astonishing enough, a
                science student from British Columbia, distressed at the plight
                of her friend studying without electricity, got engaged into
                experimenting with solid-state devices.She eventually created a

                <p>Teenagers today exploit many wireless systems daily, but not
                many wonder how to make use of this luxury to meet ‘needs’.
                Playing around with radio frequency devices, Brad Mager devised
                a three-dimensional system that alerts caretakers if someone
                has fallen to the ground. Another similar device built by
                roboticists integrates obstacle sensors and a Bluetooth device
                with a walking stick, thus giving crucial warnings to blind
                people by the use of a headset.</p>


                <p>With many such accomplishments being reported daily, it
                shouldn’t go unnoticed that the wonders marveled by these
                ‘geeks’ have kindled out of a straight-forward approach,
                providing solutions that cater to necessity rather than
                pandering man with luxury. By conceptualizing reality instead
                of imagination, they teach us an important lesson: Doing
                science is light-years away from studying science. Yet, all it
                takes to bridge the gap is curiosity. Geeky, is definitely the

                <p style="margin-left:10px">It is sometimes so difficult to
                believe or even think about the existence of some things, and
                that’s because these are so different from normal that our mind
                is unable to accept them or the reasoning behind them. This is
                somewhat true for Black Holes, one of the strangest things ever
                dreamt or seen by science.</p>

                <p>Black Holes were first of all pointed out in 1783. It was
                brought forward that there are some regions in space that could
                not be seen but a very strong impact of force could be felt
                around them. This was the gravitational force due to a massive
                star, so strong that even light could not escape. Such regions
                or objects of space were then called Dark Stars and are now
                called Black Holes.</p>

                <p>Suppose there is a massive star that has burnt up its
                nuclear fuel completely, then if it cools and shrinks below a
                critical size, it will literally end up making a hole in space
                that light can’t get out of, i.e., a Black Hole. From the
                outside you can’t tell what is inside a black hole. Even when
                you throw something inside a black hole and once its inside,
                you are wrong if you say that you know what you threw inside,
                because all that black hole remembers is the total mass and the
                state of rotation. Everything else gets lost inside. The force
                experienced due to a black hole varies with positioning; it is
                strongest at its boundary which is called the Event Horizon.
                Even light gets trapped inside at this region, and since
                nothing can travel faster than light, everything else also can
                be pulled inside.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:10px;">Once you fall in a black hole, as for the
				outside world, you would be lost forever. The only thing that
				remains in the black hole is information. All the mass inside the
				black hole gets converted into energy (E= mc squared) and energy
				finally into information. So, bigger the black hole more is the
				information inside it. But it was also discovered that particles
				could leak out of a black hole but on a very small scale, if they
				somehow happened to travel at a speed greater than light. This was
				brought forward after the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle; you
				may know the position of a particle, that it’s in the black hole,
				accurately, but then, not the speed it may have
				inside.</p>

            <p style="margin:10px">If particles escape from black holes, they
            will eventually start losing information and as a result, will
            shrink and may even disappear. But the problem is that what comes
            out of a black hole has no relation with what goes in, i.e.,
            something random will come out. The information for what fell in is
            completely lost apart from the total mass. Right now we don’t have
            any black holes near us but what if we do in future? It is
            therefore very important to determine whether information really
            gets lost in black holes, whether it can be recovered or
            preserved.</p>

                <p>12 Rupees per kilometer? I almost presumed Indians have
                assembled a flying auto-rickshaw when I first learned about
                Mangalyaan.</p>

                <p>India's first Mars orbiter, popularly and officially known
                as ‘Mangalyaan’, witnessed its much anticipated launch with
                Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle-C25 (PSLV C-25) on 5 November
                2013 from Sriharikota launch pad, and is expected to reach its
                destination orbit on 14 September, 2014. The ISRO space probe
                started its nine-month 400 million kilometer long odyssey
                towards the red planet to look for the presence of Methane in
                Martian atmosphere. <img height="200" src=
                "../booklet/images/pop/14.jpg" style="margin:10px; float:right"
                width="150">The cost of the project is $72.9 million (about Rs.
                450 Crores) which is approximately and surprisingly costing
                just Rs. 12 km per hour! Success of this mission is definitely
                expected to establish an Asian hegemony of India in the
                aerospace domain.</p>

                <p><strong>Objective and Minutiae</strong></p>

                <p>According to Indian scientists it’s the showcase of Indian
                technology in the form of an attempt to study space conditions
                beyond Earth’s orbit. Once into the Mars orbit, the 1.3-tonne
                orbiter will attempt to capture concrete details of climate,
                geological conditions and evidence of water, with thermal
                infrared sensors. Five scientific instruments that have been
                deployed on board will help to ascertain any sign of life on
                the planet. With its successful launch, India becomes the sixth
                nation to be heading towards the red planet.</p>

          <p style="margin-left:10px;"><strong>Point of Criticism</strong></p>
				<p style="margin-left:10px;">Although the mission cost
				is cheap according to the standard of a developed country,
				implementation of the mission has gone through severe condemnation
				in India itself. Economists and social activists have criticized
				criticized the amount of money spent on this mission, questioning
				the negligence to problems of food resources, clean water and poor
				sanitation persisting in the country. Some space research
				scientists have also argued with ISRO that the focus should have
				been on developing new satellites for commercial sector.

            <p style="margin:10px;">In the words of an ISRO Spokesperson, “The
            primary goal is the technical demonstration. This will help us by
            advancing our existing technology in communications and Earth
            observation satellites. We hope it will also inspire younger
            minds.”</p>

            <p style="margin:13px;">Having that said, the ‘flying
            auto-rickshaw’ of India seems to offer a promising future for the
            country in space exploration.</p>

                succeeded. A perpetual motion machine is basically a device
                which, once set in motion, continues to produce energy without
                any external intervention. Simply put, it is a wheel which

                <p style="margin-left:10px">Another kind of perpetual motion
                machine is usually defined as one that completely eliminates
                friction and other dissipative forces, to maintain motion due
                to inertia of mass. But such a device is impossible to make, as
                friction cannot be eliminated totally in any
                system.</p>

                <p>Early designs of perpetual motion machine were made by
                Indian mathematician Bhaskara-II, during the 12th century.
                Bhaskara described an overbalanced wheel that he claimed would
                run forever. Leonardo Da Vinci made numerous drawings of
                devices that he believed would make free energy. Another 16th
                century Italian scholar proposed a self-blowing windmill.

			motion cup which he claimed
                could sustain fluid flow forever. More perpetual motion devices
                followed in 17th century. None of these worked.</p>
			<p style="margin-left:10px;">In 1775, The Royal Academy of Sciences in
            Paris, having had enough, made a statement that “The Academy will
            no longer accept or deal with proposals concerning perpetual
            motion.” Later, even the United States Patent and Trademark Office
            made an official policy of refusing applications regarding
            perpetual motion machine without a working model.</p>
            <p style="margin:10px">Regardless of this, the madness behind
            perpetual motion machine still continues and every year the patent
            offices around the world receive many applications regarding
            perpetual motion machines, most of them fraudulent or
            non-working.</p>

            <p style="margin:10px">Even though I am not the type to discourage
            new inventors, but still I would like them to steer clear from
            perpetual motion because it’s long been established that it’s a
            wild goose chase. As appropriately put by Leonardo Da
            Vinci,<br></p><center><strong>“Oh ye seekers after perpetual motion, how
            many vain chimeras have you pursued? Go and take your place with
            the alchemists!”</center></strong><br>

                <p style="margin-left:10px">Hey, look! Here pass millions of
                neutrinos from your book. Oh my God, now they have crossed the
                moon!</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px">You must be thinking, “What is it?
                I couldn’t see anything”. Well, relax. You are right. If you
                could actually see them, you wouldn’t have required a bulb to
                study at night. The small size and huge quantity of neutrinos
                furnish them with a tendency to behave similar to photons, thus
                imparting the potential to illuminate a night as a day. They
                are particles so light that even a 100,000 neutrinos may not
                balance one electron, but considering their titanic abundance
                in the universe, they may overtake the mass of matter present
                on our planet. Unfortunately, even half a century after their
                discovery, there’s little that we know about them.</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px;">While studying the emissions produced in certain radioactive
                transitions, the existence of tiny neutral particles was first
                predicted by physicist Wolfgang Pauli. He asserted on the basis
                of certain observations and experiments that the virtually
                massless particles would rarely interact with matter.</p>
<p style="margin-left:10px;">Arising out of fusion,
                Solar Neutrinos engender as a result of the nuclear reactions
                taking place in the core of the Sun and other stars. In due
                course of time, the ongoing research and experiments have
                indicated that even animals and humans produce another class of
                neutrinos as a byproduct of decomposition of their skeletal
                system.</p>

            The low mass and neutral charge of a neutrino impart it an
            exceedingly weak interaction with other particles and fields. Such
            attributes interest scientists because they indicate that neutrinos
            can be used to probe environments that other radiations (such as
            light or radio waves) cannot penetrate, thereby making it a
            particle of paramount importance to disentangle many mysteries.

                <p style="margin-left:10px">Have you ever tried to climb the
                walls like a ‘SPIDERMAN’ or found yourself boasting about your
                very own bulletproof ‘IRONMAN’ suit? A sound sleep with ‘sweet
                dreams’, wasn’t it? Well, it is not a dream anymore. Troy
                Hurtubise’s latest invention, ‘The Trojan S Series’ is a
                protective suit of modern armor i.e. the Ironman. Hurtubise
                claims that the suit, which is just weighing 13.6 kilograms,
                can withstand gunshots from a very close range and is light and
                flexible, making it easy to run, climb and drive in. This was
                made possible because of the ballistic grade protective panel
                which he invented and used in the Trojan Suit. This panel is
                able to deflect twelve bore shots and knives. So if you want to
                become the next Ironman you will just have to pay £35,000! But
                if you are not really interested in the Ironman, you can rather
                glide over the Gotham city like our own ‘BATMAN’. The
                ‘Gryphon’, having a wingspan of 1.8 meters and weighing 30
                kilograms, is made up of light and durable material like carbon
                fiber. It can cruise for 50 kilometers and when pointed
                downwards, the Gryphon can reach to a terminal velocity of 250
                miles per hour, fast enough to dodge away the Joker’s bullet
                easily.</p>

                <p style="margin-left:10px;">Designed and developed by Spelco, the Gryphon costs around £
                10,300. Unfortunately if you or your kids want to become the
                next Spiderman, you will just have to wait a little. Keeping in

                mind the pace at which modern technology supersedes itself, it
                won’t take very long.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:10px;"> A wave of robots is in development that
                would climb vertical surfaces by using the phenomenon of
                induced electrostatic attraction, which is induced between the
                climbing pad and the surface it touches. Switching off and on
            the current allows the pads to move. Current prototypes can carry
            up to 34 kilograms of weight and according to Nicola Pugno, who is
            currently working on the man version size of this robot, there is
            no fundamental reason that why can a robot not carry 90 kilograms
            of weight.</p>
