                        <b><u>The bona-fide evil</u></b><br />
                        The regime of visiting Ravana year after year on the eve of Dussehra has become intrinsic to our lives now. But let me tell you something. Something they do not tell you in those awe-inspiring mythology books.  We do not just set his effigy on fire. Our act signifies sheer impudence. We practically spit on his soul by dishonouring him publically, tantalizing the demon across the nation. Yet that isn’t enough for we come back again the next year. And since it takes two to do the tango, the ‘Dashanan’ is bound to return. The cycle goes on. A total bummer!
                        <br /> That makes me wonder, what makes us go to the Dussehra ground and burn him down to ashes year after year? Do we really go there, having the thought of obliteration of evil in our minds? Or is it more of a getting-the-mind-off-stuff attitude that drives us there? Moreover, imparting such physical torture, bringing down those three colossal structures with a thud, why do we get that immense satisfaction? When did we turn EVIL?

            <div title="sixth page" style="border:thick dashed;">
                <p style="padding:0px;margin:2%">
                    Well, it’s not our repugnance for the Lanka-lord that triggers the desire to give him a visit, but our affinity for the whole ceremony and the way it is done, that does the trick. The entire population joined at the hip, united around one idea- “The triumph of good over evil.” But in this case, evil cannot be shunned once and for all, for we love it too much.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b><u>Comparison with an Indian Wedding</u></b><br />
                    The Dussehra ground glistens. The hubbub baffles me. The enactment of this barbaric yet creative drama is held across the country, enthralling large parades participating enthusiastically. It’s a jamboree for people of all ages. Exuberant and eager and dressed to their nines, the mob gets ready, gathering up for the merriment blood bath.
                    Overjoyed and euphoric are the little ones who leave no stone unturned to seize a spot in the front line of the crowd. Then there are the womenfolk, dressed impeccably in glittering saris and stunning dresses. They don’t really come to watch the Ravana, if you ask me. Nor they are interested in the other events going on. So what do they do there? Women are allowed to carry a deadly weapon wherever they go and can use it whenever they wish to. Their tongue! The elderly can also be seen sharing a gossip or two, imparting their wisdom and knowledge about the festival to the young ones.

                    The amount of enthusiasm present in the ground could make Thomas Hobbes cringe in despair. A gush of excitement flows through all, as they wait for the ten-headed demon to bite the bullet.
                    And now days, things are getting even queerer, spiralling out of control. There is a post-burning celebration.  Stalls of food snacks are spread over the ground with a stage and a DJ organized, as Ravana becomes the butt of myriad jokes. Yes. A DJ! Consuming some form of entertainment after such a visceral-act. We truly deserve it, don’t we? In a nutshell, I cannot spot much of a difference between the Dussehra ground and an Indian wedding ground, except for the three larger-than-life effigies.
                    <br /><br />
                    <u><b> Man-work and Consequences</u></b><br />
                    With youths of the village working their socks off, every year they make it a point to improve upon the effigy’s height. Even a couple of superfluous feet require a Herculean effort. Working round-the-clock they craft the devil from wood and bamboos and use coloured papers for decorating it. The creation of an effigy is painstaking work, but the rewards are tangible, ranging from anywhere between Rs.1000 to 3.4 million right now.
                    And as he disintegrates, the entire year’s patience and efforts are lost in the winkling of an eye. Shouldn’t the time, effort and resources be invested on something more imperative and fruitful? But we would rather rely upon religion and mythologies than to act more rationally. No wonder they call us the Third World.
                    And, do we ever think of the ramifications caused by this civil commotion? It’s not only the mystical emperor we bring to knees. It’s also our environment. Noise pollution, harm to birds and animals, diseases from the release of harmful gases from fireworks, global warming; the list is endless.

                    The sheer enjoyment of the overall ceremony puts blinkers over our eyes! Is there no healthier way of symbolizing the triumph of good over evil?
                    <br /><br />
                    <u><b>The Best Part of it</u></b><br />
                    For eons I have been bothered a lot with this so-called festival, for I repeatedly found myself questioning the very foundations of it.
                    Let us recall that distasteful incident for a moment.
                    According to our so-called Hindu Mythology, a king known as Ravana allegedly abducted a lord’s wife, took her to his country, did not even touch her once, treated her with respect and gave her food, clothing and shelter. Was it that horrific that we mortify him every year? A public holiday all over the country, so as to humiliate him in the evening, isn’t it a little too much of vindictiveness on our part? Shouldn’t we desist ourselves from doing this every year? I’m sure Ravana would like to bury the ghosts of his past.
                    As the social ills are budding each day, I ask you, why don’t you burn down effigies of assassins, rapists, and murderers? Do they not commit a crime more heinous than Ravana did? And how about crafting dummies of the modern day demons like crime, drugs, alcohol, lessons of hate and ugly gossip, and kindle them publically?

                            The worldly often views a religious person as distant, dogmatic and lacking in intellectual insight. In our spiraling materialistic tendencies, the devout are often ridiculed and believed to be inept in social context. By virtue of their faith, they are tagged as backward and conservative. The materialist tends to be presumptuous and thinks that a religious person won’t drink or smoke, is irrational and orthodox. Hence pious people are looked upon as societal misfits.<br /><br />
                            If, for instance, a religious person achieves a major position somewhere, he is regarded as odd and an annoyance to those around him because he refuses to take bribes! In schools and colleges, some students wear prominent religious marks on their foreheads and their classmates take pride and delight in mocking and degrading them. Sometimes he (or she) may even be physically attacked for his religious beliefs.<br /><br />

                    The life of a religious person is not easy. He has to look for a path that allows him to follow his values in an environment that is constantly trying to pull him down. The mundane person, in comparison, is a social chameleon who ceaselessly changes his color to match his surroundings. In a second, he can turn from capitalist to communist, companion to foe, Jekyll to Hyde. He has no ethics, beliefs or goals, except those that are conducive to his crude bodily inclinations.<br /><br />
                    However, the pious person understands that though he may be a social misfit, others are misfits of a different kind. They are transcendental misfits. The 'religious social loner' knows that one day, the world will turn to his way of thinking. He sees everybody as being essentially spiritual, they having become corporeal only superficially.<br /><br />
                    The more we broaden our horizons - even on the materialistic level - the more spiritual we become! It is only when we narrow ourselves and our horizons, that we become ordinary and dull. Today, everyone is a misfit. You have to find out which one you are and which one you want to be - social or spiritual.<br /><br />

                    Garnering memories is a risky pastime. Well, a bone of contention according to today’s scenario. But I stick to it. I rarely take pictures, and I no longer keep a regular diary. This habit has its own grassroots story.
                    <br /><br /> Some years ago, writing in a diary used to be a customary activity. I would return from school and dedicate the expected hour to diligently documenting the day's events, feelings and impressions in my little black leather volume. Moreover, the utopian profiles of people on social networking sites, showcasing their impeccable clicks, aroused the keen interest for photography. Hence, I used to think that pictures blended with words are worth limitless emotions and memories.
                    <br /><br /> Once, I went on a trip and observed that I became obsessed with chronicling every occurrence. Whatever name and place I encountered was readily noted down and captured in my camera. I had many photographs of myself, places, lush green vegetation and scenic beauties of nature.
                    
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div title="eleventh page" style="border: thick dashed; height: 97%">
<p style="margin:2%"> I uploaded all of them on social networking sites and plenty of “likes” swept in. Indeed, acclamation by adoration. As per my mind’s fabrication, I was trying to seek contentment and calmness through them. But, unfortunately, it was missing. Therefore, on the following day, I left my camera and diary and just strolled along the sites.
<br /><br />At that point, I understood that nothing I wrote could ever parallel or replace the few seconds I allowed myself to experience the infallible beauty of my surroundings. All the past days sounded useless and stale. All the sentences I had so tenderly molded and all the pictures I had enthusiastically captured just indicated the dull characterization of those events. By putting my adventure into perspective, I completely forgot to live it. Then, I realized that if I stay too preoccupied behind the camera in the hope of cherishing these memories in the future, my present will simply pass by me. I don’t want to wake up one day with piles of photos to which I am not connected. Maybe, in this way I will forget the precise representations of people and places but at least those experiences will stay inside me and ring a bell.
<br />     <br />I don’t live to make memories. I just live and the memories form themselves.

                    On a Sunday morning at 10 a.m., when I was comfortably snoring in my bed, my phone vibrated for the 6th time in a row. On answering the phone, a very energetic and enthusiastic voice from the other side said “Don’t make any plans for the day, we are going for a play”. I asked which play and my best friend said “Vagina Monologues”. My eyes popped out right then. I made sure I had heard the name correct. I wasn’t sure to watch it and got surrounded by questions like what it would be all about.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div title="thirteenth page" style="border: thick dashed; height: 97%">
            <p style="margin:2%">
                Thinking of all this just made me uneasy. My nervousness was at its peak at the ticket counter. Even taking the name of the play gave me goose bumps.
                <br /><br />   After being seated, the host asked how many people could say the word ‘vagina’ comfortably. He wanted the audience to get at ease with the subject of the play. He took the name of the play over and over again. The word vagina echoed from every corner. Finally, after repeatedly listening to him, sweat drenched faces became normal. And by the end of the play, I can guarantee that most of the people were confident enough to say ‘vagina’ loud and clear.
                <br /><br />  The penis and vagina are body parts just like our nose, knee, big toe or liver.  Why should we be ashamed, or at the very least be uncomfortable saying those two words? Why can’t we just use the anatomically correct words?
                <br /><br />  This taught me a lesson that needs to be jotted down in block letters. The only way to ease out our awkwardness is to speak up and have a wider horizon and not make a huge deal out of such petty issues. It is healthy to have conversations about anything and everything. We have the right to put forward our opinion for each and every issue. And if we cannot gather the courage to say something as simple as a ‘vagina’, how are we going to speak on issues like sex, live-in relationships, prostitution, homosexuality, etc.
                <br /><br />  No one ever gained anything from keeping mum. Ignition is what is needed and that is what this play did for me, “The play that dared to use the V-word”. So it’s better to unzip our mouths and speak what is correct.
                <br /><br />   By writing this article, I have tried, to the best of my ability, to break down the stigma around such words.  I would appreciate if you think where your comfort level is when using the words penis and vagina.  Are you totally comfortable spitting these words out or do these words only belong in the doctor's office?

                    Gone are the days when people used to feel the fire of patriotism in their hearts. Gone are the days when great revolutionaries dared to sacrifice their lives. Bhagat Singh and Mahatma Gandhi have become an anachronism today. The love and affection towards one’s nation has taken a back seat. A possible reason of such a situation where patriotism cannot be seen around is the unpatriotic government officials who are selfishly enjoying their position which they got from the sacrifice of our national heroes. Our freedom fighters sacrificed their lives to clean up the British regime, restored the whole system with a new hope of independence and this is that very system which is full of corruption, allegations, selfish officials and lawmakers who aren’t patriotic at all. Literally, it is true that nothing burns like patriotism. Rather, real patriotism was burnt the day when selfish and corrupt feelings arose in those very people who run this country.

                <br /><br />   Today, even after 66 years of independence, our country is still facing the problems of poverty, unemployment and various such issues. The question is- why have the policies of our government failed to curb these problems? Where the hell do the funds assigned to such policies go? Why is our so called patriotic government which is said to be elected from the people & by the people, not able to deliver what it takes to be a united and prospering country? The only answer is lack of patriotism, lack of love for the country, lack of love for the country’s people and the highly prevailing selfish & greedy interests of our lawmakers.
                <br /><br />   Even the common man has lost interest in this nation. People like me and you are so much fed up of this system that we want to flee away from this system. Had the government been patriotic and provided the nation with the growth and development which we need today, had the government not been selfish and catered to the needs of the nation instead of feeding their own bellies, this nation would have been a superpower in the world and a much better place to live in. Today, how many of us celebrate the Independence Day with a feeling of patriotism? I think it’s rather the joy of break that we get from our working schedule on a national holiday. And the joy totally vanishes if the Independence Day lies on Sunday. Patriotism is evidently not burning in our hearts. We are busy and self- centred people who care least about the nation.

                    Let me give you another example. Hosting International games such as Olympics, Commonwealth Games etc. provides an opportunity to the nationals to identify with and take pride in their nation’s development. In 2008, when China hosted Olympics, they were swept by a wave of patriotism and headline-grabbing scams and scandals were not there to dampen the mood which is altogether contrary to India’s recent Commonwealth Games.
                    <br /><br />Though the feeling of patriotism has faded, but, I would say, the concept of patriotism is still there. I will tell you how. Take Ramdev Baba. He has commercialised patriotism and is encashing it for materialistic gains. “Swadeshi apnao, videshi bhagao” strategy of Ramdev’s Patanjali trust exemplifies  how he is making money by selling indigenous products in the name of patriotism.
                    <br /><br />India is eagerly waiting for the day when a staunch leader would take charge of this nation, the day when cheap and nasty politics would subside to its minimum level, the day when India would begin to prosper.

                    This isn’t an article meant for waxing lyrical about Roger Federer’s achievements as a tennis superstar. This isn’t about the accolades and awards he wins on a daily basis. This piece is about an athlete rising above the materialism, cheats and scandals that have marred the sporting community, and giving back to his fans. I just want to tell a story which I read on the web and which touched my heart, and took my admiration for Federer to greater heights.
                  <br/>  This is the story of Beatriz Tinoco, a 17-year-old teenager hailing from Maryland who had survived a battle with cancer in 2011/2012. She made a simple wish to the Make-A-Wish Foundation in 2012 -meeting Roger Federer.

            <p style="margin: 2%; text-align: center">
                In June 2013, she was told that ESPN was doing a piece on her high school tennis team and that is when she was told that she’ll be meeting her idol. The way she was informed is no less than a fairytale in itself. A video of Roger greeting her with, "Hi Beatriz, I heard you're a big fan of mine, so I'm inviting you with your family to come watch me play at Wimbledon. Go pack your bags, have a safe trip, and I'll see you there” freaked her out in her own words.
                <br />   She flew to London the very same week and met Roger for the first time in the players’ lounge. He greeted her with a hug and talked to her for some 15 minutes. The meeting was supposed to end there but Federer, being a mensch if there ever was one, invited her to watch his practice with fellow player, Lleyton Hewitt. She was even introduced to Federer’s entourage- his coach Paul Annacone, Swiss Davis Cup captain Severin Luthi and others. She even got a chance to hit with Roger on the court. She was scared because she felt that she was good but nothing out of the ordinary. But she overcame all her anxiety when Roger’s coach, Paul, told her not to be scared of Roger at the net “because it was all pressure, he wasn't even that good”. Just when she thought that Roger had already gone beyond the call of duty and done enough, he told her that he was going to see her two days later for a tour of the Wimbledon grounds. She was shown around the all the SW19 courts the following Sunday, including the Centre Court which is often called the ‘holy ground of tennis’, by Roger and the Chairman of Wimbledon himself. If all this hadn’t surpassed her expectations already, he invited her to his press conference and even kept it on hold until she arrived. After being done with all the interviews (he does press in 3 languages, just so you know), he met Beatriz and her family in the players’ lounge and signed autographs and other tennis related stuff for them, personally addressing each one of them. To describe the end of the meeting, I’d quote her exact words, for she has written beautifully how she felt:
                <br /> “He stayed a lot more than he had to for sure. But then the people from ESPN tried kind of       finishing things up so that he could leave before his manager freaked out. So he went around the table hugging my mom, my dad and my sister, and then it was my turn. He told me I had been through a lot and hugged me really hard and I just started crying so much in his shoulder (it was around that time that the picture from my avi was taken haha) He was like "awnn". Then when I let go of him I was still like sobbing and I turned to him and he was kind of tearing up :') I thanked him and then he went.”
                <br /><br /><br />
                So there you have it: Roger Federer, the people’s champion.

                    Ross and Rachel don’t kiss on ‘Friends’ anymore. Howard and Bernadette get married and never have the ‘you may now kiss the bride’ moment. Would the sex, drugs and rock & roll fuelled TV show Californication be worth watching without the sex, drugs and rock & roll? I don’t know why channels even bother airing movies like ‘Bad Teacher’. And what is the sense of taking out scenes from a superhero film like ‘Iron Man’?
                <br />In an effort to appeal to younger viewers without exasperating the older ones, Indian TV is now showing some of America's edgiest shows - but cutting out the edge. Here’s why... Apparently Indian audience is not mature enough to read words like ‘condom’ or ‘sex’. I say ‘read’ because they are perfectly loud and clear when the character is saying them in the show or the movie. But when it comes to the subtitles, the words have been asterisked or changed to be made suitable. </p>
            </div>

        <div title="twentysecond page" style="border: thick dashed; height: 97%">
            <p style="margin: 2%; text-align: center">
                So, ‘I don’t give a shit’ becomes ‘I don’t give a jerk’, and even ‘Breastfeeding’ becomes ‘Chest-feeding’. I once witnessed a subtitle that went ‘It is a b*** to my self-esteem’ – the censored word was blow!!! It is almost as if people with jobs of subtitling and censorship don’t know English at all. Censors often let the spoken word slide through, but change it or strike it completely from the subtitles. So while a character on Mean Girls is allowed to say the word "lesbian", the subtitles show "queer".
                <br /><br />    In a country with an estimated 146 million TV-viewing households, the government reserves the right to sanitize programming, usually to make sure that nobody offends multiple ethnic and religious groups as well as their societal sensibilities. And there’s the other big reason these days to censor content. The government in its own well-intentioned way is trying to avoid allowing millions of people to watch programming that its civil servants worry might inflame lust, particularly at a time when the world is expanding its image of India to include men running amok and raping women right and left.
                <br /><br /> The FIRSTPOST reported: “One incident turned an episode of Friends into a legend of unwatchable TV. The show hinged on the gag that two pages in a cookbook got stuck together and the character Rachel mistakenly made a fruit pastry with beef. The station bleeped out the word beef, a show of sensitivity for Hindus' reverence for cows, leaving viewers to guess why her diners were so disgusted.”
                <br /><br />  It’s true that children have no business watching adult shows but that’s the parents` duty to turn the TV off. The parents need to monitor what their children are looking at on television. So it makes no sense that you watch the legendary ‘Hangover’ on TV while most of the movie has been cut to make it “suitable for family viewing in India”.
                <br /><br />  I wish this arbitrary and mindless editing stops so I wouldn’t have to force myself to press the off ‘B**t on’ every time I try watching an American sitcom on TV.

Men, the influential ones, seem intent on enjoying their liberty and often turn Nelson’s eye on the issue of equality of women.
                <br /><br />  The most disturbing question is-why are women considered as the weaker sex? Women have their presence felt in every walk of life, be it domestic or a non-domestic front. They have succeeded in contributing significantly in fields like military, defence, financial and banking sector, science and technology among many others.
                <br /><br />  Women all around are fired with instructions on how their conduct should be at every phase of their lives. Amidst the many voices that bark these orders there lacks a sense of assurance. The other side of the coin portrays an entirely different scenario. Men everywhere have the freedom to choose and guard their decisions. Why? Women, like men, must have the liberty to take stand on every aspect of their lives and should not suffer from the consequences of this ultimate act of dominance.
                <br />Women shouldn’t sell themselves short as they must realise they’re worth their weight in gold. As rightly quoted by Eleanor Roosevelt, “A women is like a tea bag- you can’t tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water”. The ability of women shouldn’t be questioned and this evil act of discrimination should be put to a stop.
